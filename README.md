# BornHack 2021 DIY Badge

This badge is a little different than the BornHack badges from previous years, where instead of focusing on writing code that will run on a microprocessor, this badge focuses on the electronics side, and simple electronics components

There are a few things that are prepared on the badge, specifically the Shitty Add On/Simple Add On/SAO standard connector and a place for a Qwiic/Stemma QT connector for interacting with modules in that eco system over I2C.

## Designed in KiCad nightly (5.99)

This board is designed in a recent KiCad nightly build, and will therefore require the nightly (5.99) version of KiCad to open up properly. The schematic as a PDF is included for reference.
